JS project to pull solana wallet token balances into a csv file, pulling token names and symbols from JUP/all
may as well get the prices while we're here..
just realised that the full coingecko list already includes the token address so there's no reason to use JUP any more
keeping it, it's a nice way to filter out unneeded tokens
